Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;", "publisher": "Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "not_recommended": 2, "ratingscount": 4819, "image": null, "playingtime": 240, "avgrating": 7.17548, "minplaytime": 240, "published": 1986, "maxplaytime": 240, "minplayers": 3, "minage": 14, "maxplayers": 5, "suggestedage": 14, "mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "categories": ["Economic", "Negotiation", "Political"], "artists": ["Marcus Gschwendtner", "Harald Lieske"]}, {"id": 2, "language_dependence": 2, "best": 4, "name": "Dragonmaster", "designer": "G.

Moon", "recommended": 6, "description": "Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;", "publisher": "AMIGO", "not_recommended": 1, "ratingscount": 7468, "image": null, "playingtime": 60, "avgrating": 6.52821, "minplaytime": 60, "published": 1998, "maxplaytime": 60, "minplayers": 2, "minage": 10, "maxplayers": 6, "suggestedage": 8, "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Card Drafting", "Point to Point Movement", "Route/Network Building"], "categories": ["Fantasy", "Travel"], "artists": ["Doris Matth\u00e4us"]}, {"id": 11, "language_dependence": 1, "best": 5, "name": "Bohnanza", "designer": "Uwe Rosenberg", "recommended": 3, "description": "Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.&#10;&#10;The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them.

(source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely.

Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.

A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings.

Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises.

However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized.

The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well.

A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30.

This player becomes the new active player for the next round.&#10;&#10;Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.&#10;&#10;Note: &quot;Party Box&quot; editions include all cards from Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #1 and Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #2&#10;&#10;", "publisher": null, "not_recommended": 2, "ratingscount": 16445, "image": null, "playingtime": 30, "avgrating": 5.74433, "minplaytime": 30, "published": 1999, "maxplaytime": 30, "minplayers": 4, "minage": 12, "maxplayers": 10, "suggestedage": 8, "mechanics": ["Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Humor", "Party Game"], "artists": ["John Kovalic", "(Uncredited)"]}, {"id": 75, "language_dependence": 2, "best": 6, "name": "Falling", "designer": null, "recommended": 4, "description": "This game is from an odd genre, real-time card games.

Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.

To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;", "publisher": "Hans im Gl\u00fcck", "not_recommended": 2, "ratingscount": 21558, "image": null, "playingtime": 120, "avgrating": 7.62113, "minplaytime": 60, "published": 1995, "maxplaytime": 120, "minplayers": 2, "minage": 12, "maxplayers": 5, "suggestedage": 12, "mechanics": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Card Drafting", "Area Movement", "Memory"], "categories": ["Medieval", "Renaissance"], "artists": ["Doris Matth\u00e4us"]}, {"id": 94, "language_dependence": 1, "best": 4, "name": "Union Pacific", "designer": "Alan R.

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.&#10;&#10;The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.&#10;&#10;The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.
